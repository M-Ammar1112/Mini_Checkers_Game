# Mini_Checkers_Game

## INTRODUCTION:
The 6x6 Mini Checkers game is a simplified version of the classic checkers game, played on a 6x6 square board. Each player starts with 6 pieces, placed on the black squares of the board, with the goal of capturing all of the opponent's pieces. The game mechanics and rules are similar to classic checkers, with players taking turns moving their pieces diagonally, making captures by jumping over opponent's pieces. The game is implemented using data structures, algorithms, and a GUI developed in Python using the Tkinter library, offering an exciting and engaging experience for players of all skill levels because it has two difficulty levels.
